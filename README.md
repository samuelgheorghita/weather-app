# Weather App

## Description

This app shows both the current and forecast weather of cities all over the world based on the user's input.  
In this project I experimented with different web APIs, such as "GeoDB Cities API" and "OpenWeatherMap API". I processed the data returned, condensed it and displayed it into a 5 days forecast. I also used and explored "react-accessible-accordion" and "react-select-async-paginate" libraries.

## Technologies used

HTML, SCSS, REACT
